# Project activity #3 (Team-based project work)

## Project design architecture & vlog presentation

### Preliminary 

This activity is about the architectural software design of your team's project. Here, your team will explore and submit appropriate diagrams and models regarding key design aspects, including an MVC architecture diagram (what does your team envision being represented in the model, view, controllers?), assorted UML(ish) diagrams (process, data, class diagrams), lo-fidelity sketches of the envisioned application, and updated project management documentation as needed/required (including GitHub Project Board/Kanban, user stories, and MVPs). As per activity #1, a brief vlog (video blog, 5-10 minutes in duration) is required. For this vlog, it is expected that your team will discuss your team's project design architecture (going over key visuals as per document/visual activity requirements). Your team's vlog, and other associated deliverables, are to be posted on your team's GitHub and your team's URCourses team project wiki (vlog link only under "Vlogs" section). All submitted files are due in GitHub and/or URCourses by the date/time specified (timestamps will be confirmed). 

#### Deliverables must include

- [x] MVC architecture diagram (go through envisioned elements of each separation of concern) ✅ 2022-11-02
- [x] Assorted UML-ish (and other) diagrams (process, data, classes). Visuals should demonstrate how team's are utilizing a domain-driven design approach ✅ 2022-11-01
- [x] Lo-fidelity graphical user interface sketches and/or high-fidelity user interface designs (using Adobe XD or Figma) ✅ 2022-11-01
- [x] Create a user questionnaire that will enable you to evaluate your lo/hi-fidelity prototypes. Your questionnaire should direct potential users to test out the interaction "flow"/usability of completing key activities on your design (e.g. if you have created a movie database like IMDB your questionnaire should ask potential users to comment on their ability to "search for a movie" or "find all movies a certain actor (e.g. John Candy - one of Tim's all-time favs) has acted in") ✅ 2022-11-01
- [ ] Other documents as the team feels/wishes to explore  
	- [ ] Tech Debt Management Plan
- [x] Update GitHub [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/teamcrusher/projects/3) (Kanban) with updated [user stories](https://github.com/orgs/teamcrusher/projects/4) and RACI visuals (as needed) ✅ 2022-11-01
- [x] Updated and rationalized [MVP](https://github.com/orgs/teamcrusher/projects/2)s (as needed) (on GitHub Project Board if possible or some other document) ✅ 2022-11-01
- [x] Create a team project progress vlog, going over key aspects that your team provided in your project design architecture (as per the stated requirements - see "Vlog criteria" below). Ensure your vlog is posted both to your team's GitHub **and** your team's URCourses project team wiki (under "Vlogs"). NOTE: You'll likely have to upload your vlogs to YouTube (or some other streaming service) first and post the links to both GitHub and URCourses due to upload limitations/constraints ✅ 2022-11-02
- [x] Your team's project introduction vlog should at least be 5 minutes and no more than 10 minutes in duration as per the "Vlog criteria" below (at a minimum) ✅ 2022-11-02
- [x] Individually submitted self/peer review files (MS Word .docx template), uploaded to URCourses (using "Activity #3 self/peer review submission" upload link) ✅ 2022-11-02

### Vlog Criteria

For this vlog, it is expected that your team will discuss your team's project design architecture (going over key visuals as per document/visual activity requirements).

#### Project idea refresher

#### "Show me what you got!"

Discuss your team's project design architecture, linking your discussion to the various visuals your team created for this activity (including all/key diagrams, your updated (or unchanged) GitHub Project Board/Kanban, associated user stories, and envisioned MVPs and rationale)   

#### Team reflection
