## Project idea
An educational platform for Tetris strategies and techniques where members can interact with an embedded game and catalog strategies or techniques with community feedback. 

## Project background/Business Opportunity
Modern Tetris has a small but dedicated community of players who wish to take the game to its absolute limits. Many players strive to improve by learning new strategies and refining their craft, with the help of wikis maintained by top players such as four.lol or harddrop.com. 


However, there few tools to practice these strategies directly, currently they can play the game on Tetris clients such as jstris, fourtris, or tetr.io by creating situations themselves to practice. This is inefficient and requires understanding of the setup to properly execute. Thus, a lot of beginners will plateau.


Team Crusher will create a learning platform which helps members -- especially beginners, to familiarize themselves with the game and prepare with proven knowledge of strategy at every level. By providing practical exercises to enhance knowledge though interacting with the user, our platform will allow players to hone their skills. Our platform would have a intuitive UI/UX for learning and interaction, bringing a more immersive learning experience with each advancing level like Brilliant or chess.com.

## Business Opportunity
Our target audience of the project is Tetris beginners who are passionate to improve their multiplayer Tetris skills for whom our primary goal is to create an educational strategy platform with good interactivity.
